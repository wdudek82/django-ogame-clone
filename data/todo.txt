    - buildings
    - resources (summary + management: % capacity)
    - facilities
    - research/discoveries/technologies

        - adding random planet's image
        - calculating sector of the universe for the home planet

3. Additional:
    - construction ques
    - (dynamic) progress bars

4. Logging events:
    - moon destruction
    - fleet movements
    - probe missions
    - building/factory changes
    ...is it viable? Should I use separate DB (like MongoDB) for that?
